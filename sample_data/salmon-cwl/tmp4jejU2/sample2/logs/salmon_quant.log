[2017-05-05 14:14:31.073] [jointLog] [info] Computed 21 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2017-05-05 14:14:31.073] [jointLog] [info] Counted 10000 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-05-05 14:14:31.079] [jointLog] [warning] Only 10000 fragments were mapped, but the number of burn-in fragments was set to 5000000.
The effective lengths have been computed using the observed mappings.
